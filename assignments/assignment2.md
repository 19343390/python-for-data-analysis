### Assignment 2 - Bash, Conda, IPython, and Jupyter

Work through these tasks. Copy and paste the commands and output for the first two sections to a text file; for the third section, because these are Jupyter notebooks, type out your answers directly in the text file. Turn in the text file as your completed assignment. Please name your file `2_first_last.txt` or `2_first_last.md` (substitute your first and last name).

#### A. Installing Miniconda and working with Conda

1. Make a conda environment called `python2` that's identical to your `python3` environment but using Python 2.
2. Practice activating and deactivating conda environments.
3. Use `conda install` and `pip install` to install additional packages to your environment.
4. List your conda environments.
5. List the packages installed in one of your environments.
6. Optional: If you are familiar with R, create an environment and install the R kernel using the instructions [here](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r).
7. Optional: If you are familiar with QIIME, create an environment and install QIIME using the instructions [here](http://qiime.org/install/install.html).

#### B. Python and IPython command-line interpreter

1. Launch your `python3` conda environment and find out which version of Python you are using. Then try to run the commands `print 'Hello, world'` and`print('Hello, world')`. Do they both work?
2. Launch your `python2` conda environment and find out which version of Python you are using. Then try to run the commands `print 'Hello, world'` and`print('Hello, world')`. Do they both work?

#### C. Working with Jupyter notebooks and Python basics

1. Launch your `python3` conda environment and then launch the Jupyter notebook server. Which kinds of notebooks can you create? Open a Terminal within the notebook environment and determine your Python version.
2. Launch your `python2` conda environment and then launch the Jupyter notebook server. Which kinds of notebooks can you create? Open a Terminal within the notebook environment and determine your Python version.
